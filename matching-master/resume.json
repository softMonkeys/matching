I can assure you any task I am given will be performed with a high degree of professionalism and skill.\n\nThroughout my career I have had the opportunity to work with some very skilful, knowledgeable and respectable mentors, working along side them enabled me to become calm and collected in a fast paced environment and also incredibly efficient.\nMy initial training took place in an a' la carte restaurant in which I moved on to become head chef, at Piccolo we took a \u201cfrom scratch\u201d approach to all of our meals, this has given me the knowledge and skill to become more refined and creative in the industry.\n\nMy passion for food, travel and winter sports, along with a love of like minded people keeps me extremely motivated,\nI recently finished a winter season in Australia filling a seemingly similar position therefore I believe I would adapt quite quickly and be an integral part of your team.\n\nI am able to start In late February, Please don't hesitate to contact me for any further information.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJames Clerke",

I have always envisioned the responsibilities and joy of being a cook. My past experience will surely be a value addition to this post and its responsibilities. \n\nI have worked in the kitchen sector as a steward and dishwasher for four years ensuring that all the day to day responsibilities are carried out with perfection. Even though I have completed a degree in Computer Science Engineering, I worked part-time as a kitchen steward during this time. From that time, I became passionate about working in a fast kitchen environment. I am very much aware of the hygiene and proper storage of produce, meats and dairy products. I am very excited about my work term because my post-graduate studies in Hospitality Management at Selkirk College will be completed by April, 2016 and I hope to continue working for the Mike Wiegele Helicopter Skiing after my work term. I consider this is my best chance to work in a fast paced kitchen.\n\nI am sure this work experience as a cook will be a new learning opportunity for me. To take this forward I would very much love to talk with you and discuss a possible way forward. If you have any concerns or want any further clarifications, please feel free to contact me at 250-687-4821 or email me at nidhinzachariahkos@edu.selkirk.ca\n\n\nThank you\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nNidhin Zachariah Koshy",
